## -------- preliminary website --------
The Workshop on Algorithms and Complexity (Theorietag) is a recurring event featured by [Fachgruppe Algorithmen](https://fg-algo.gi.de/) and [Fachgruppe Komplexität](https://fg-kp.gi.de) of the [Gesellschaft für Informatik](https://gi.de/).
A list of past occurrences can be found [here](https://fg-kp.gi.de/aktivitaeten/theorietage/archiv).

The workshop is aimed at all those interested in research in the field of theoretical computer science.
The focus is mainly on complexity, algorithms and data structures, as well as parallel and distributed algorithms.
Participation in the workshop does not constitute a publication, so both ongoing and completed work can be presented.
A declared goal of the workshop is to enable contact between young and senior scientists.

We hope and currently expect that the workshop can take place offline again for the first time since the beginning of the pandemic.
