title: "82. Workshop on Algorithms and Complexity (Theorietag)"
---
The Workshop on Algorithms and Complexity (Theorietag) is a recurring event featured by [Fachgruppe Algorithmen](https://fg-algo.gi.de/) and [Fachgruppe Komplexität](https://fg-kp.gi.de) of the [Gesellschaft für Informatik](https://gi.de/).
A list of past occurrences can be found [here](https://fg-kp.gi.de/aktivitaeten/theorietage/archiv).

- **Start**: 08.06.2022, 13:00
- **End**: 09.06.2022, 11:30
- **Organizer**: [Anselm Haak](/~haak) 
- **Invited talk**: Pascal Schweitzer from Darmstadt will talk about "The Theory of Practical Graph Isomorphism Solving".
- **If you would like to attend**, please register by E-Mail to [theorietag@uni-frankfurt.de](mailto:theorietag@uni-frankfurt.de) until **25.05.2022**.
- **If you plan to give a talk**, please include the title and abstract (preferrably LaTeX) in your mail, also by **25.05.2022**. If there is a corresponding manuscript available online, please also send the link for that. Talks should be ~25 minutes long (including discussion).
- **Location**: PA Building on Campus Westend of Goethe-Universität Frankfurt, which is building 10 on the map below ([Google Maps](https://goo.gl/maps/aWg9m4CfQuEMkTDn7)), see [here](https://www.goethe-university-frankfurt.de/73011530/Goethe_University_Locations?locale=en) for directions to the campus.

The workshop is aimed at all those interested in research in the field of theoretical computer science.
The focus is mainly on complexity, algorithms and data structures, as well as parallel and distributed algorithms.
Participation in the workshop does not constitute a publication, so both ongoing and completed work can be presented.
A declared goal of the workshop is to enable contact between young and senior scientists.

The workshop will take place offline again for the first time since the beginning of the pandemic.
