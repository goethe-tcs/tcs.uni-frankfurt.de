The [International Collegiate Programming Contest](https://icpc.global/) (ICPC) is an international coding competition for Bachelor and Master students.
Participants form a team and train together to solve programming puzzles.
If that sounds interesting to you, then you should consider participating in the ICPC.
Please email [bembel-coding@dlist.server.uni-frankfurt.de](mailto:bembel-coding@dlist.server.uni-frankfurt.de) to be invited to a Discord-Server where we coordinate our activities.

## Bembel-Coding

Bembel-Coding is a series of events and activities at the Goethe-University Frankfurt, geared towards fostering the fun of programming.
On November 10, 2023, we hosted the [**Will Code for Drinks**](/wcfd) (WCFD) event with about 70 participants, and in December 2023, we advertise the [**Advent of Code**](/aoc).
Bembel-Coding is currently organized by [Prof. Dr. Holger Dell](https://holgerdell.com).
