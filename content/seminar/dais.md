## Contents

This seminar is intended for Bachelor and Master students who are excited about *theoretical computer science*, including algorithms and complexity.
You will learn about and present on current research papers in the area, and you will actually get to meet the authors of these papers in person!
This is because attending all sessions of the research colloquium [Discrete Algorithm Insights Seminar (DAIS)](https://dais.rhein-main-universitaeten.de/) is an integral part of this seminar.

## Organization

- **Time:** During the semester, every Friday at 13-15h, in-person.
- **Location:** Bockenheim Hörsaalzentrum, H 3. _Important: Several sessions will take place in Mainz or Darmstadt!_

## Required activities

- Attend all sessions of the seminar as well as all sessions of the research colloquium [DAIS](https://dais.rhein-main-universitaeten.de/). Bring a laptop to each session.
- Give a short talk at the beginning of the semester and a long talk towards the end of the semester. Blackboard and slides (PowerPoint or similar) are both fine. You must submit a draft of your long talk at least **two weeks before your long talk**.
- Use LaTeX (mandatory) to write a report (3-5 pages, excluding references and figures) on the topic of your long talk. The deadline is **four weeks before your long talk**. Your report and your talk must include at least one proof that you found interesting. Use this LaTeX-template without modifying the layout (such as margins or font sizes): [github.com/goethe-tcs/note-template](https://github.com/goethe-tcs/note-template).
- Give and receive formal feedback on talks and reports.
- Formulate and ask at least one question on the contents of each talk.
- The grade is based on your report, talks, feedback, participation, attendance, and timely submission of the required activities.
