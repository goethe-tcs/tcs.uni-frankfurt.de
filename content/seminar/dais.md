## Overview

This seminar is intended for Bachelor and Master students who are excited about *theoretical computer science*, including algorithms and complexity.
You will learn about and present on brand-new research in the area.
Moreover, you will actually get to meet international researchers in person!
This is because attending all sessions of the research colloquium [Discrete Algorithm Insights Seminar (DAIS)](https://dais.rhein-main-universitaeten.de/) is an integral part of this seminar.

## Organization

- **First session:** You will be invited by email.
- **Time:** During the semester, Fridays at 13h or at 14h, in-person.
- **Location:** Room 307, Robert-Mayer-Straße 11-15, 60325 Frankfurt am Main. _Important: Several sessions will take place in Mainz or Darmstadt!_

## Mandatory activities

- **Attendance:** Attend all sessions of the seminar as well as all sessions of the research colloquium [DAIS](https://dais.rhein-main-universitaeten.de/). If you cannot attend a session for an important reason, you must inform us in advance.
- **Short talk:** At the beginning of the semester, give a short talk of at most 10 minutes on a topic of your choice, using professional slides (Google Slides, PowerPoint, Keynote, LaTeX-Beamer, ...).
- **Draft of long talk:** You must submit the draft slides of your long talk at least **two weeks before your long talk**.
- **Long talk:** Towards the end of the semester, give a long talk of at most 30 minutes on a recent research paper, using professional slides.
- **Report:** Submit a report of 2-4 pages on the topic of your long talk **two weeks after your long talk**. The report should contain an outline of your talk, describe the contents of your talk, as well as formally state all references, results, definitions, and possibly proofs that were mentioned in the talk. Use this LaTeX-template (mandatory) without modifying the layout (such as margins or font sizes): [github.com/goethe-tcs/note-template](https://github.com/goethe-tcs/note-template).
- **Engagement:** Give and receive feedback on talks and reports. Formulate and ask questions about the contents of the talks.

## Topics

Your short talk and your long talk can be about the same or different topics.
The short talk can be about a topic of your choice, as long as it is related to theoretical computer science, such as a recent paper or a chapter from a textbook.
For the long talk, you should choose a paper that was presented at a recent top conference in theoretical computer science, such as
[HALG 2024](https://halg2024.ideas-ncbr.pl/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/HALG2024-agenda-03.06.2024-update.pdf),
[STOC 2024](https://dblp.org/db/conf/stoc/stoc2024.html),
[FOCS 2023](https://dblp.org/db/conf/focs/focs2023.html),
[SODA 2024](https://dblp.org/db/conf/soda/soda2024.html), or
[ICALP 2024](https://dblp.org/db/conf/icalp/icalp2024.html).
**Please send us your topic choices by October 31st, we must approve them.**

## Grading

Your talk and report will be evaluated as *exemplary*, *satisfactory*, or *unsatisfactory*.
You can and should revise your talk based on our feedback on the draft slides, and you can revise your report at most once after receiving our the feedback.
Your grade is calculated as follows:
