## Contents

This seminar is intended for Bachelor and Master students who are excited about theoretical computer science, including algorithms and complexity.
You will learn about current research papers in the area, and you will actually get to meet the authors of these papers in person!
This is because attending the four sessions of the research colloquium [Discrete Algorithm Insights Seminar (DAIS)](https://dais.rhein-main-universitaeten.de/) is an integral part of this seminar.

## Organization

- **Time:** During the semester, every Friday at 13-15h, in-person.
- **Location:** Bockenheim Hörsaalzentrum, H 3. _Important: Two or three sessions will take place in Mainz or Darmstadt._

## Required activities

- Participate as an audience member in all 4 sessions of the research colloquium [DAIS](https://dais.rhein-main-universitaeten.de/).
- Give a short talk at the beginning of the semester and a long talk towards the end of the semester.
- Give and receive feedback on all talks.
