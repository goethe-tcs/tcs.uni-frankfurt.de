## Description

Complexity Theory is a beautiful field that studies different models of computation as well as their relationships to each other. The most famous open problem in this field is the P vs. NP problem. In this course, you will discover elegant proof techniques, fascinating ideas, and exciting open questions.

## Time and Place

- **Lectures.** Tue 12-14, Wed 10-12 in H9.
- **Tutorials.** Tue 10-12 in H9.

## Grading

- There will be 3-4 mandatory written assignments; you can solve them in teams of size 2.
- The **written exam** will take place on Tuesday, July 19 at 10-13 in H10.

## Week plan

The summer term has 14 weeks, the following is a preliminary plan:
