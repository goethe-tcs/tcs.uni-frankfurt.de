## Description

Complexity Theory is a beautiful field that studies different models of computation as well as their relationships to each other. The most famous open problem in this field is the P vs. NP problem. In this course, you will discover elegant proof techniques, fascinating ideas, and exciting open questions.

## Time and Place

- **Lectures.** Tue/Wed 10-12 in H9.
