## Teaching Philosophy

The goal of our teaching activities is to provide an excellent learning environment for each student.
Learning happens in each student's brain when the student is actively engaged with the material, for which reason the focus is on what the student is doing, and not on what the teacher is doing. The role of the teacher is to select effective learning activities and suggest them to the student.

### Concrete goals

- Make learning fun
- Continuously improve the learning environment that we provide
- Use transparent assessment criteria

### Teaching methods

For undergraduate courses, we often use teaching methods inspired by the "flipped classroom" concept:

- **Pre-class**, students watch videos, read in the literature, and start to work on some basic exercises.
- **In-class**, students solve exercises in small groups; teaching staff is present to support students when they have individual questions.
- **Post-class**, students work on homework assignments.
