## <i class="fas fa-flask"></i> Research

My main research interests are in the interaction of computer science and logic as well as more generally complexity theory.

Previously, I have worked on counting complexity, descriptive complexity, circuit complexity, parameterized complexity, first-order and second-order logics and team semantics.
I'm also always interested in exciting new directions of research related to my fields of study.

# computer science and logic

#   >data complexity of different problems in logics
# complexity theory
#   >parameterized complexity

# on the "logics"-side: worked with first- and second-order logic as well as first-order team logics
# on the complexity-side: counting complexity, circuit complexity, parameterized complexity
