## <i class="fas fa-flask"></i> Research

My main research interests are in the interaction of computer science and logic as well as more generally complexity theory.

Previously, I have worked on counting complexity, descriptive complexity, circuit complexity, parameterized complexity, first-order and second-order logics and team semantics.
I'm also always interested in exciting new directions of research related to my fields of study.
