Each semester, we foster a friendly community of students who are excited to do fun projects in theoretical computer science!
Possible project types include:

- Bachelor's thesis (~9 weeks full-time)
- Master's thesis (~6 months full-time)
- _Forschungsprojekt_ (Bachelor: 3CP or 6CP; Master: 8 CP)
- _Praktikum Experimentelle Algorithmik_ (Master: 8 CP)

Interested? Great! Read this entire page and apply by **Friday, April 1, 2022**.

## Prerequisites

- You must have successfully completed
  - all basic mathematics and algorithms courses, and
  - a [course on scientific writing](https://www.starkerstart.uni-frankfurt.de/100074566/).
- If you want to write a Master's thesis, you must have attended at least two advanced courses and/or seminars in theory.

## Project Flavor

All projects offer a fun challenge.
Depending on your interests and talents, different _flavors_ of projects are possible:

- **implementation projects** (recommended for most students): This includes understanding one or multiple advanced algorithms, as well as designing and performing systematic algorithmic performance experiments. It is also possible to design, implement, and critically analyze educational and interactive visualizations of algorithmic concepts.
- **proving theorems** (recommended only for students who have successfully completed advanced theory courses and/or seminars, and who can demonstrate excellent grades): This requires reading one or multiple papers including mathematical proofs, designing new algorithms, and proving new theorems.

Often, there is some overlap between different project flavors.
[This page](/teaching/project-ideas) describes possible projects in more detail.

## How to apply for a project

- We accept new students at the start of each semester. If you are interested, email us by **April 1, 2022**. (If you miss the deadline, you will have to wait until October 1, 2022.)
- Topics will be assigned at the first meeting, on **Tuesday, April 12, 2022, at 2-4pm** in room **H 10** (or online).
- **Timeline.** In general, the thesis project must be completed during class period and not during the semester break. For a Bachelor's thesis, this means you will have 1-3 weeks to agree with your supervisor on a project plan. Then you will officially register your thesis project and finish the thesis within 9 weeks.
- Please email [tcs-projects@dlist.server.uni-frankfurt.de](mailto:tcs-projects@dlist.server.uni-frankfurt.de). In your first email:
  - Clearly state **why** you are interested in doing a project in theoretical computer science as opposed to some other area. Why are you applying here?
  - Beyond the basic lectures, which **theory experience** do you have? (seminars, advanced lectures, etc.)
  - As specifically as possible, let us know your timeline! **When** do you want to finish the project, when can you start it, how much time will you be able to put into the project?
  - Please tell us your ALGO1 and ALGO2 grades.
  - Which project type are you interested in? (e.g., Bachelor's thesis)
  - Which project flavor are you interested in? (e.g., implementation or proving theorems).
  - Would you be interested to work in a small group? (yes, you can write a Bachelor's thesis in a group of 2-3 people.)
