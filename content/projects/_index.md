Interested in a fun and challenging thesis project in theoretical computer science?
Great! Read this entire page and apply by **Thursday, September 1, 2022**.

## Prerequisites

- You must read the [guidelines for projects in the TCS group](/projects/guidelines).
- If you want to write a Master's thesis, you must have attended at least two advanced courses and/or seminars in discrete mathematics or theoretical computer science.
- Specific topics may have additional prerequisites.

## Topics

The TCS group offers a variety of theory projects and coding projects.
After you have applied, we will contact you in October and propose some available thesis topics then.

**Examples of past projects (not yet available):**

- Bachelor thesis: Max Mustermann (2021). _Solving Systems of Polynomial Equations over Finite Fields_ [pdf]
- Bachelor thesis: Marie Musterfrau (2021). _Visualisierung von MST und SSSP Algorithmen_ [[www](https://jamyumyum.github.io/), [source](https://github.com/JamYumYum/JamYumYum.github.io), pdf]

We also describe the [general flavor of possible topics](/projects/flavors) on a separate page.

## How to apply?

- Please email us at [tcs-projects@dlist.server.uni-frankfurt.de](mailto:tcs-projects@dlist.server.uni-frankfurt.de) by **Thursday, September 1, 2022**. If you miss the deadline, you will have to wait until February 1, 2023, to work on a project in the summer term of 2023.
- In your first email, answer the following questions:
  - Why are you interested in doing a project in theoretical computer science as opposed to some other area?
  - Which theory experience do you have? (seminars, advanced lectures, teaching assistant, etc.)
  - When do you want to finish the project, when can you start it, how much time will you be able to put into the project?
  - What grades did you have in ALGO1 and ALGO2?
  - Are you interested in a Bachelor's thesis, Master's thesis, or research project?
  - Which topic would you be interested to work on?
  - Would you be interested to work in a small group? (yes, you can write a Bachelor's thesis in a group of 2-3 people.)
- Topics will be assigned at the first meeting.

<!-- ### Timeline for a Bachelor's thesis in the summer term of 2022

- April 1: Application deadline.
- April 12: Topics assigned.
- April 22: Draft of project plan handed in for feedback.
- April 29: Give a 20-minute talk about your planned project.
- May 2: Project plan finalized & official registration of thesis with the [examination office](https://www.uni-frankfurt.de/103337868).
- June 20: Full thesis draft handed in for feedback.
- July 4: Thesis officially submitted.
- July 12: Give a 30-minute talk about the results of your project. -->

## Project Flavor

All projects offer a fun challenge.
Depending on your interests and talents, different _flavors_ of projects are possible:

- **implementation projects** (recommended for most students): This includes understanding one or multiple advanced algorithms, as well as designing and performing systematic algorithmic performance experiments. It is also possible to design, implement, and critically analyze educational and interactive visualizations of algorithmic concepts.
- **proving theorems** (recommended only for students who have successfully completed advanced theory courses and/or seminars, and who can demonstrate excellent grades): This requires reading one or multiple papers including mathematical proofs, designing new algorithms, and proving new theorems.

Often, there is some overlap between different project flavors.
[This page](/projects/flavors) describes possible projects in more detail.

## Formalities

Possible project types include:

- Bachelor's thesis (~9 weeks full-time)
- Master's thesis (~6 months full-time)
- _Forschungsprojekt_ (Bachelor: 3CP or 6CP; Master: 8 CP)
- _Praktikum Experimentelle Algorithmik_ (Master: 8 CP) -->
