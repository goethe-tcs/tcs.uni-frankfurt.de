## Fully-funded PhD position (3 years) in ADYN research unit

The research unit "Algorithms, Dynamics, and Information Flow in Networks" ([ADYN](https://adyn.cs.uni-frankfurt.de/)) is inviting applications for a PhD or Postdoc position, starting as soon as possible.
The research is going to be carried out at Goethe University Frankfurt under the supervision of [Holger Dell](/~dell) in collaboration with other ADYN members.

### Topics

The project has the title "Parameterized Complexity of Network Dynamics", and is about dynamic processes on graphs, such as virus, or fake news, spreading through a social network. During the project, you will learn, develop and employ mathematically provable analysis techniques for such processes. The goals are to analyze dynamic processes based on structural parameters of the graphs, to determine the parameterized and fine-grained complexity of inference and influence problems for such processes, and to develop techniques to study dynamic processes on temporal graphs.

### We Offer

- A fun and meaningful research project at the intersection of parameterized complexity, statistical physics, and graph theory.
- A friendly, open-minded, and supportive social environment.
- Individual guidance and a rich network of collaboration partners.
- Possibility to attend workshops, conferences, and summer schools.
- Flexible working hours and the position is also available part-time.
- Competitive salary (100% E 13, roughly 50k € gross per year)

### We Expect

- Curiosity, ambition, and diligence.
- A finished or almost finished Master's degree (or equivalent) with good grades in Computer Science, Mathematics, Physics, or similar.
- The inclination and ability to quickly learn about discrete mathematics, probability theory, statistical physics, graph theory, parameterized algorithms, and fine-grained complexity theory.
- Professional level of English in both speaking and writing. (German is not necessary.)
- For postdoc candidates, a strong publication record is required.

### Apply

Please compile your application and e-mail it to tcs-applications@dlist.uni-frankfurt.de. Your application should include **as a single PDF file**:

- A cover letter, indicating why you are interested in the position and what you can contribute to the project. (This does not need to be a formal letter.)
- The names and contact details of one or two references.
- Your curriculum vitae.
- Your transcripts of grades (both Bachelor and Master).

Please also include as separate PDF files:

- Your Bachelor thesis (if available)
- Your Master thesis or a draft (if available)
- For postdoc candidates: Your most important paper (that is, the one where you have written most of the text)

**The application deadline is June 16, 2023, at 2pm Frankfurt time.** We hope that all interviews will be held via video call on June 22 between 10am and 5pm Frankfurt time. If the funding agency gives final approval, which is likely, then the position can start from July or later.

<!-- ## Full-time position in the e-Learning Project Algo-Learn {#algo-learn}

The _Theoretical Computer Science_ group at Goethe University Frankfurt is looking for a computer scientist (or similar) with a passion for teaching algorithms to help develop our e-learning platform _Algo-Learn_. We offer a full-time or part-time position for 16 months. If necessary, the work can be done remotely from within Germany. Moreover, part of the time (25%) can be used for self-guided research either in theoretical computer science or in e-learning (but it is not a PhD position). The project is commencing as soon as possible and is going to be carried out under the supervision of Prof. [Holger Dell](/~dell).


**Project Overview.**
The goal of the project is to develop a fun and interactive e-learning platform for typical undergraduate algorithms courses. The project focuses on designing exercises that facilitate interactive problem-solving activities, providing students with hands-on experiences that can be used for practice and self-assessment. The role entails:

- Crafting didactic objectives for the platform.
- Coding interactive exercises and visualizations.
- Enhancing the learning experience, e.g., by incorporating gamification elements.
- Ensuring rigorous quality assurance processes.
- Leading a team of student assistants who help develop and test the platform.
- Learning industry-standard web development tools, such as [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [React](https://react.dev/), and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

Our aim for the platform is to match the quality and style of Duolingo. Check out an [early prototype](https://tcs.uni-frankfurt.de/algo-learn/) and its [source code](https://github.com/goethe-tcs/algo-learn).

**We Offer.**

- The possibility to work on a fun and meaningful e-learning project.

- 25% of your time can be used for self-guided research in theoretical computer science or in e-learning.

**We Expect.**

- A finished or almost finished Master's degree (or equivalent) in Computer Science, Mathematics, Physics, or similar.
- Proven knowledge in algorithms and complexity, e.g., through your thesis or tutoring experience.
- Capacity to lead a small team of student research assistants.
- Professional proficiency in English; German skills are a plus, but not mandatory.
- Preexisting knowledge of web development is a plus, but not mandatory.
- Working 3 days per week on-site in Frankfurt is a plus. If this is not possible for you, you must be willing to travel for occasional meetings. Moreover, for legal reasons, you must be registered in Germany, or be willing to move to Germany at least for the first few months of the project.
