- Professional level of English in both speaking and writing. (German is not necessary.)

**Apply.**
Please compile your application and e-mail it to [tcs-applications@dlist.uni-frankfurt.de](mailto:tcs-applications@dlist.uni-frankfurt.de). Your application should include **as a single PDF file**:

- A cover letter, indicating why you are interested in this particular position and what you can contribute in terms of your skills and interests. (This can be a short text and should be as concrete as possible.)
- The names and contact details of one or two references.

## Fully-funded PhD position (3 years) in ADYN research unit

The research unit "Algorithms, Dynamics, and Information Flow in Networks" ([ADYN](https://adyn.cs.uni-frankfurt.de/)) is inviting applications for a PhD or Postdoc position, starting as soon as possible.
The research is going to be carried out at Goethe University Frankfurt under the supervision of [Holger Dell](/~dell) in collaboration with other ADYN members.

### Topics

The project has the title "Parameterized Complexity of Network Dynamics", and is about dynamic processes on graphs, such as virus, or fake news, spreading through a social network. During the project, you will learn, develop and employ mathematically provable analysis techniques for such processes. The goals are to analyze dynamic processes based on structural parameters of the graphs, to determine the parameterized and fine-grained complexity of inference and influence problems for such processes, and to develop techniques to study dynamic processes on temporal graphs.

### We Offer

- A fun and meaningful research project at the intersection of parameterized complexity, statistical physics, and graph theory.
- A friendly, open-minded, and supportive social environment.
- Individual guidance and a rich network of collaboration partners.
- Possibility to attend workshops, conferences, and summer schools.
- Flexible working hours and the position is also available part-time.
- Competitive salary (100% E 13, roughly 50k € gross per year)

### We Expect

- Curiosity, ambition, and diligence.
- A finished or almost finished Master's degree (or equivalent) with good grades in Computer Science, Mathematics, Physics, or similar.
- The inclination and ability to quickly learn about discrete mathematics, probability theory, statistical physics, graph theory, parameterized algorithms, and fine-grained complexity theory.
- Professional level of English in both speaking and writing. (German is not necessary.)
- For postdoc candidates, a strong publication record is required.

### Apply

Please compile your application and e-mail it to tcs-applications@dlist.uni-frankfurt.de. Your application should include **as a single PDF file**:

- A cover letter, indicating why you are interested in the position and what you can contribute to the project. (This does not need to be a formal letter.)
- The names and contact details of one or two references.
- Your curriculum vitae.
- Your transcripts of grades (both Bachelor and Master).

Please also include as separate PDF files:

- Your Bachelor thesis (if available)
- Your Master thesis or a draft (if available)
- For postdoc candidates: Your most important paper (that is, the one where you have written most of the text)

**The application deadline is June 16, 2023, at 2pm Frankfurt time.** We hope that all interviews will be held via video call on June 22 between 10am and 5pm Frankfurt time. If the funding agency gives final approval, which is likely, then the position can start from July or later.

## E13 Position (75%, 16 months) as a Front-end Developer for Algo-Learn {#algo-learn}

We are excited to announce a position that combines modern front-end development with teaching algorithms: The _Algo-Learn_ project of the Theoretical Computer Science group at Goethe University Frankfurt is seeking applications for an E13 position to develop an ambitious learning platform in Algorithms and Complexity. The position is commencing as soon as possible.
The work is going to be carried out under the supervision of [Holger Dell](/~dell).

**Project Overview.**
The project focuses on designing, developing, implementing, and evaluating exercise generators that cover foundational competencies in theoretical computer science and algorithms. The exercises will facilitate interactive problem-solving activities, providing students with hands-on experiences that can be used for practice and self-assessment. The role entails:

- Leading a team of student assistants who help develop and test the platform.
- Crafting didactic objectives for each exercise generator.
- Implementing these exercise generators using industry-standard tools, such as [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [React](https://react.dev/), and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).
- Enhancing the learning experience, e.g., by incorporating gamification elements.
- Ensuring rigorous quality assurance processes.
- Collaboratively evaluating the didactic quality of tasks and the entire platform.

Our aim for the platform is to match the quality and style of Duolingo. Check out an [early prototype](https://tcs.uni-frankfurt.de/algo-learn/) and its [source code](https://github.com/goethe-tcs/algo-learn).

**We Offer.**

- A unique opportunity to shape the future of digital education in computer science.
- Collaborative working environment.
