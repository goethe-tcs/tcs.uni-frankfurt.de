## Overview

There are three options:

1) Apply for the PhD/postdoc positions in this group, see below for further information.
2) Apply for a postdoc fellowship by the [Alexander von Humboldt Foundation](https://www.humboldt-foundation.de/en/apply/sponsorship-programmes/humboldt-research-fellowship).
3) Apply for a PhD, postdoc, or visitor fellowship by [DAAD](https://www2.daad.de/deutschland/stipendium/datenbank/en/21148-scholarship-database/).


## Open call for applications

The research group lead by [Holger Dell](https://holgerdell.com) at
Goethe University Frankfurt is inviting applications for two PhD or
Postdoc positions, starting as soon as possible.
The group conducts research on fundamental questions
of computation and information, is driven by curiosity, and provides a
friendly, open-minded, and positive social environment. Potential
future research topics of the group include, but are not limited to,
algebraic graph algorithms, the theory of machine learning on graphs,
circuit complexity, pseudorandomness, fine-grained and parameterized
complexity. Excellent teaching is important to the group, and both
positions include some teaching duties.

### Tasks

- Identify and work on the most interesting research problems in
  theoretical computer science.
- Publish the findings at top-tier venues.
- Support undergraduate and graduate teaching activities.
- Pursue further scientific qualification (e.g., doctorate).

### We Offer

- A friendly, open-minded, and positive social environment.
- Individual guidance and a rich network of collaboration partners.
- Possibility to attend workshops, conferences, and summer schools.
- Competitive salary (100% E 13, roughly 50k â‚¬ gross per year)
- A vibrant, international, well-connected city.

### We Expect

- Curiosity and a strong interest in team-based rigorous
  fundamental research.
- Sociability and an ambition to make teaching great.
- A finished or almost finished Master's degree (or equivalent) with
  good grades in Computer Science, Mathematics, Physics, or
  similar. For postdoc candidates, a PhD is required.
- Robust knowledge in discrete mathematics or theoretical computer
  science.
- Good command of English in both speaking and writing. Some knowledge of German is an advantage for the teaching, as not all students are fluent in English.
- (for the postdoc position) A track record in the form of publications.

### Apply!

Please compile your application (including a short research statement,
CV, transcripts of grades, name and contact details of one or two
references) as a single pdf file and e-mail it to tcs-applications@dlist.uni-frankfurt.de.  If you have a thesis or
thesis draft, please include that as well. Please indicate clearly whether you're applying for a PhD or a postdoc position.
The application deadline is June 15 2021, but candidates will be considered until the position is filled.

The Goethe University Frankfurt promotes gender equality at work, which is
why women are particularly invited to apply.
