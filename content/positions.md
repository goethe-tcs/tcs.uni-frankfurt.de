## Open call for applications

The research group by [Holger Dell](https://holgerdell.com) at
Goethe University Frankfurt is inviting applications for two PhD or
Postdoc positions, starting at the earliest possible date.
Potential topics include research of the type that is published at
top-tier conferences such as STOC/FOCS/SODA. This includes, but is not
limited to, complexity theory, (algebraic) graph algorithms, the theory
of machine learning, fine-grained complexity, and parameterized complexity.

### Tasks

- Identify and work on the most important research problems in
  theoretical computer science, and publish in top-tier conferences.
- Support undergraduate and graduate teaching activities.
- Pursue further scientific qualification (e.g., doctorate).

### We Offer

- A friendly, ambitious, and positive social environment.
- Individual guidance and a rich network of collaboration partners.
- Possibility to attend workshops, conferences, and summer schools.
- A vibrant city.

### We Expect

- Curiosity and a strong interest in team-based rigorous
  fundamental research.
- Sociability and an ambition to make teaching great.
- A finished or almost finished Master's degree (or equivalent) with
  very good grades in Computer Science, Mathematics, Physics, or
  similar. For postdoc candidates, a PhD is required.
- Robust knowledge in discrete mathematics or theoretical computer
  science.
- Good command of English in both speaking and writing. Most teaching
  is done in German, so some knowledge of German is an advantage.

### Apply!

The Goethe University Frankfurt promotes gender equality at work, which is
why women are particularly invited to apply.

Please compile your application (including a short research statement,
CV, transcripts of grades, name and contact details of one or two
references) to a single pdf file and e-mail it to the secretary
C. Gressler (gressler@em.uni-frankfurt.de).  If you have a thesis or
thesis draft, please include that as well.  Feel free to contact Holger
Dell (dell+2021+applications@cs.uni-frankfurt.de) in case you have any questions.
Candidates will be considered until the position is filled. -->
