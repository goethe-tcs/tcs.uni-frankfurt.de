# tcs.uni-frankfurt.de

We mimic the general layout of the main [Goethe-Universit√§t Frankfurt](https://www.uni-frankfurt.de) website, with some opinionated improvements. Feel free to use it for your own sites. Pull requests are welcome!

For local development:

- Install your favorite package manager. For example, [bun](https://bun.sh/).
- Install [hugo](https://gohugo.io/).

Then run:

```bash
bun install
```

to install the dependencies,

```bash
bun run build
```

for building, and

```bash
bun dev
```

to start up a server for local development.
